# ViReMaShiny
 A Shiny app that generates figures for ViReMa analyses

## What is ViReMa?
ViReMa is an algorithm developed by the Routh and Johnson Labs providing “a versatile platform for rapid, sensitive and nucleotide-resolution detection of recombination junctions in viral genomes using next-generation sequencing data”. Code for ViReMa is written in Python and can be downloaded here - https://bioconda.github.io/recipes/virema/README.html.
